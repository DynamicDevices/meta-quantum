# meta-quantum-safe

A Yocto layer to start exploring the world of quantum safe cryptography
## TODO:

- Add support for crypto-safe library implementations at [https://openquantumsafe.org/](https://openquantumsafe.org)
- Samplesâ€¦
(1) to encrypt and decrypt a key
(2) take the QS encrypted key and encrypt a message with it (symmetric key)
(3) do an end to end demo over MQTT
- Ask what else is needed here?
